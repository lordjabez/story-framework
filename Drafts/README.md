## Naming Convention

Use numbered prefixes so files sort in reading order:

```
00-table-of-contents.md   (optional)
01-chapter-one.md
02-chapter-two.md
03-chapter-three.md
```

Or for shorter works:

```
00-table-of-contents.md
01-act-one.md
02-act-two.md
03-act-three.md
```

## File Template

```markdown
# Chapter/Section Title

*Optional: location, date, POV indicator*

---

Your prose here.

---

*[Continue to Next Section](02-next-section.md)*
```

## Tips

- Commit after completing each section
- Use `{{edit notes}}` for revision markers
- Keep a table of contents updated if your work has multiple files
- Navigation links at the end of each file help when reading

## Example Table of Contents

```markdown
# Story Title

## Table of Contents

1. [Chapter One](01-chapter-one.md)
2. [Chapter Two](02-chapter-two.md)
3. [Chapter Three](03-chapter-three.md)
