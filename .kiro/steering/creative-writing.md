# Creative Writing Framework

This is a creative writing framework. Read the main instructions file for complete guidance.

## Required Reading

Read these files for full context:

- #[[file:.ai-instructions.md]] - Your role, workflow, and all behavioral instructions
- #[[file:Notes/style-guide.md]] - Voice, tone, and formatting rules
- #[[file:Notes/editing-markup.md]] - How `[[...]]` author notes and `{{...}}` edit markers work
- #[[file:creative-approaches.md]] - Six collaboration modes (Author, Muse, Artisan, Debater, Creator, Curator)

## Quick Reference

**Before writing prose:** Ensure planning docs are populated and approved:
- #[[file:Characters/characters.md]]
- #[[file:Plot/outline.md]]
- #[[file:Themes/themes.md]]
- #[[file:Setting/world.md]]

**After writing scenes:** Update continuity files:
- #[[file:Continuity/timeline.md]] - Log in-story date/time
- #[[file:Continuity/facts.md]] - Record canonical details
- #[[file:Plot/threads.md]] - Track subplots and foreshadowing

**Common commands:**
- "Process edit notes" - Find and address all `{{...}}` markers
- "Write the next scene" - Check outline, maintain continuity, write prose
- "Show me the diff" - Display uncommitted changes
- "What's the current state?" - Summarize progress and open items
