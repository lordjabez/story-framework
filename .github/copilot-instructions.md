# GitHub Copilot Instructions - Creative Writing Framework

This is a creative writing framework. Read `.ai-instructions.md` for complete guidance.

## Key Files to Read

- `.ai-instructions.md` - Your role, workflow, and all behavioral instructions
- `Notes/style-guide.md` - Voice, tone, and formatting rules
- `Notes/editing-markup.md` - How `[[...]]` author notes and `{{...}}` edit markers work
- `creative-approaches.md` - Six collaboration modes (Author, Muse, Artisan, Debater, Creator, Curator)

## Quick Reference

**Before writing prose:** Ensure planning docs (Characters, Plot, Themes, Setting) are populated and approved.

**After writing scenes:** Update `Continuity/timeline.md`, `Continuity/facts.md`, and `Plot/threads.md`.

**Inline markup:**
- `[[...]]` = Author notes (context, keep until finalization)
- `{{...}}` = Edit notes (revision instructions, process and remove)

**Common commands:**
- "Process edit notes" - Find and address all `{{...}}` markers
- "Write the next scene" - Check outline, maintain continuity, write prose
- "Show me the diff" - Display uncommitted changes
- "What's the current state?" - Summarize progress and open items
