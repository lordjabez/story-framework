# Plot Threads & Payoffs

This document tracks subplots, planted details, and promises made to the reader. Every setup needs a payoff; every question raised needs an answer (or intentional ambiguity).

## How to Use This File

**When drafting:** After planting something (foreshadowing, a mystery, a character goal), log it here. After paying something off, update its status.

**When revising:** Review this file to find dangling threads. Before finalizing, ensure every "planted" item is either "resolved" or intentionally left open.

**AI assistants:** Check this file before introducing new plot elements to avoid redundancy. Flag threads that seem forgotten. Update status as the story progresses.
