# Instructions for AI Assistants

This file provides context for AI assistants working with this story framework. Read this if you're helping with a project based on this template and don't have prior conversation history.

## Framework Overview

This is a structured creative writing workspace using:
- **Markdown files** for all content
- **Git** for version control (no versioned folders needed)
- **Inline edit markup** for revision notes

## Your Role

You're a collaborative writing partner. You can:
- Develop story elements (characters, plot, themes, setting)
- Write prose based on outlines
- Revise based on feedback
- Process edit notes in the text
- Maintain consistency with the style guide

## Key Files to Read First

1. `Notes/style-guide.md` - Voice, tone, and formatting rules
2. `Notes/editing-markup.md` - How edit notes work
3. `Characters/characters.md` - Who's in the story
4. `Plot/outline.md` - What happens

## Processing Edit Notes

Users leave inline notes using `{{...}}` markers:

```markdown
{{simple comment}}              → Note, no action
{{NOTE: explicit note}}         → Note, no action
{{FIX: something wrong}}        → Needs correction
{{CUT: remove this}}            → Delete the marked text
{{EXPAND: add more}}            → Elaborate here
{{REWORD: awkward}}             → Rephrase
{{MOVE: goes elsewhere}}        → Relocate
{{?: question}}                 → Discuss before acting
```

### Processing Workflow

When asked to "process edit notes":

1. Find all markers: `grep -rn "{{" Drafts/`
2. Categorize by type
3. Present summary to user
4. For actionable notes (FIX, CUT, EXPAND, REWORD, MOVE):
   - Show context
   - Propose specific revision
   - Wait for approval
5. For notes/questions: acknowledge, discuss if needed
6. Remove markers after resolving
7. Leave unresolved markers in place

## Git Usage

- The user manages commits manually
- You can run `git diff` to show changes
- You can run `git checkout -- file.md` to revert if asked
- Don't commit unless explicitly asked

## Writing Guidelines

- Read the style guide before writing new content
- Maintain established character voices
- Follow formatting conventions in existing files
- Don't introduce elements that contradict the planning docs
- **Create one file per chapter/act in Drafts/, numbered for sort order (e.g., `01-the-beginning.md`, `02-the-middle.md`). Never combine multiple acts or chapters into a single file.**
- When unsure, ask

## Common Tasks

**"Write the next scene"**
→ Check the outline, read prior content for continuity, write prose

**"Revise this section"**
→ Show the diff after changes

**"Process edit notes"**
→ Follow the workflow above

**"What's the current state?"**
→ Summarize: what's written, what's planned, what's unresolved

**"Help me develop [character/plot point/theme]"**
→ Ask clarifying questions, then update the relevant planning doc

## Style Defaults

Unless the style guide specifies otherwise:
- Use em-dashes sparingly (only for speech interruptions)
- Prefer periods, commas, colons, semicolons for other purposes
- Avoid over-explanation
- Show, don't tell
- Trust the reader
